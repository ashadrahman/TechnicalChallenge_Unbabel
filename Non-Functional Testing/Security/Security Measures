The point which I would like to mention here from security perspective is:

1. When I tried to logout from the Annotation Tool by clicking the logout option-> the page successfully got logged out.
2. After getting logged out -> landed on the sign in page of the annotation tool.
3. Now when I tried to click back arrorw to try to break the login, in one click it didn't went back to the logged-in page, but on another click of the back arrow->
it actually landed in the logged in page (without actually signing-in!!).

This loop-hole can cause data theft of the translations(without even logging in). This may lead to security breach.
Actually even after multiple clicks of back arrow it should not have landed back on the logged-in page. It should have kept the user logged-out in any situation, once a log-out happens.
